## Building python modules

Python applications that use supported buildsystems such as meson, cmake, or autotools can be built in the same way as regular c applications. However, many python apps and dependencies use custom install scripts or are expected to be installed through setuptools and pip.

For these cases, `flatpak-builder` provides the `simple` buildsystem. Rather than trying to automate the process like the other buildsystems, `simple` takes a `build-commands` array of strings and only executes the commands given there.

For example, this makes building the popular requests module rather straightforward:

    {
      "name": "requests",
      "buildsystem": "simple",
      "build-commands": [
        "/usr/bin/pip3 install --prefix=/app --no-deps ."
      ],
      "sources": [
        {
          "type": "archive",
          "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/r/requests/requests-2.18.4.tar.gz",
          "sha256": "9c443e7324ba5b85070c4a818ade28bfabedf16ea10206da1132edaa6dda237e"
        }
      ]
    }

`name` is the name of the module, in practice this also means the name folder in which your module will be built.

`build-commands` is an array with the commands you need to build and install your module. In this case we are running pip to do it, but the parameters are important. `--prefix=/app` is necessary, because otherwise pip would try to install it under `/usr/` and (because `/usr/` is mounted read-only inside the sandbox) it would fail.

`--no-deps` is also relevant, flatpak-builder downloads all `sources` before it starts building, and doesn't allow network access during once a build starts. This means that any attempts to download any further dependencies past that point would fail.

## Building multiple python dependencies

You'll notice that, even though it installs fine, it doesn't actually work. This is because requests has a number of dependencies that we've neglected to install:

* certifi
* chardet
* idna
* urllib3

Four dependencies aren't too much work, we could install all these using the same method and it would work just fine. However, anything more complex than this would quickly become tedious.

For these cases, we can use [`flatpak-pip-generator`](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/pip), this is a python script that takes a package name and uses pip to track its dependencies, tarball urls and hashes.

Using it is as simple as:

    $ python3 flatpak-pip-generator requests

This will output a file called `python3-requests.json` containing json data that can be directly included among your manifest's modules.
